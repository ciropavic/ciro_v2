#### IMPORTANT!!!

You *CANNOT* use these 4 resources at the same time

1. [cfx-gabz-bennys] contains Benny's as a standalone
2. [cfx-gabz-impound] contains Impound Lot as a standalone
3. [cfx-gabz-pdm] contains PDM as a standalone
4. [cfx-gabz-hub] contains all of the above (benny's + impound + pdm)

` You can only start ONE of these resources. You will have either ONE standalone interior running, or all THREE together (by running cfx-gabz-hub) `
` Running TWO will lead to crashes and/or collision and lighting issues. `

### HOW DOES THE WHITELIST SYSTEM WORK?

Our resources being encrypted by Cfx.re, your server needs to pass an authentication. This whitelisting process is automated and instant.
You have nothing to do, the Cfx.re account you used during your Tebex subscription will automatically be processed for whitelisting. 
In case you are not whitelisted, the resource won't load. Your server console will mention `You lack the required entitlement to use cfx-gabz-xxx`.
If you have any issue, please use #support channel on [discord](https://discord.gg/gabz).

### IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT ACCESS AND WHITELISTING

Purchases are tied to your Cfx.re account, not a specific license key.
If you buy a package from us, this package will work for all of your keys. 
If another Cfx.re account needs access to the package (and is permitted to), you need to transfer your license on the [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants).

With that being said, it is your responsibility to handle this with your server owner from now.
If you need your developers to have access to a paid asset, provide a development server.
The initial buyer is responsible for the subscription in case of a package transfer.
